# Contact App

## Description

Simple app to display contact information of users. App also provide feature to **ADD**,**UPDATE** and **DELETE** contacts. This app was too simple to integrate any heavy state management tool like `redux-toolkit` or use `context API` to manage state. Also all the apps features can be added into one single file so there was no need to integrate `react-router-dom`.
